# Privacy Policy for Lky Bot
# Introduction
At Lky, your privacy is important to us. We are committed to being transparent about how the bot interacts with your data. This Privacy Policy explains what data is processed by the bot, how it is used, and your rights concerning this data.

# Data Collection and Usage
Message Content
Lky requires access to the content of messages in order to provide certain features like:

AutoMod: Monitors messages for blacklisted words/phrases to help keep your server safe.
AutoResponder: Detects trigger words to automatically send predefined responses.
Logging: Records message edits and deletions for server auditing purposes.
Link to Video: Detects Instagram reel links to convert them into in-line playable videos.
GhostPing Detection: Detects mentions that are deleted, notifying users via DM when they are ghost pinged.
While Lky processes message content to perform these actions, none of the message content is stored by Lky. The bot only temporarily accesses the data needed to perform the task and does not retain any of it after the action is completed.

# User Information
Lky may process user IDs or mentions during bot operations such as:

GhostPing Detection: To notify users of a deleted mention.
Waifu Collection Game: For associating waifus with user profiles.
No personal data, including usernames or IDs, is stored. The bot only uses this information to execute its commands within the session.

# Data Storage
Lky does not store any personal data. All interactions involving user data are processed in real-time and discarded immediately after the relevant action is performed. This includes message content, user IDs, and other personal identifiers.

# Third-Party Sharing
Lky does not share any data with third parties. The bot operates entirely within the scope of Discord and does not transmit data outside of Discordâ€™s infrastructure.

# Security
While Lky processes data temporarily for operational purposes, we ensure that the bot follows best practices for security. However, since no data is stored, there is minimal risk of any personal data being compromised.

# Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the bot's features or legal requirements. Any changes will be communicated clearly, and users will always have access to the most current version of the policy.
